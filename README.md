## Introduction <a id='1'></a>

This report tackles the problem of recognizing characters in images of Natural Images. The dataset we used is called “The Chars74K“ dataset. The Chars74k contains English and Kannada. In the English language, there are 7705 characters obtained from natural images, 3410 hand-drawn characters using a tablet PC, and 62992 synthesized characters from computer fonts, which have 64 classes (0-9, A-Z, a-z). The dataset we are using is 62992 synthesized characters from computer fonts. We assess the performance of various classifiers among Nearest Neighbor, Multiple Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. Finally, it is demonstrated that the convolutional neural networks classifier has the best performance, which accuracy is over 90%.
